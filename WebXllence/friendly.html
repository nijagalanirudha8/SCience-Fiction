    <h3 id="fiction">Spider-Man's secret identity is Peter Benjamin Parker.</h3>
        <p>nitially, Peter was depicted as a teenage high school student and an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker died in a plane crash.
        Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence and financial issues and gave him many supporting characters, such as Flash Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson, and Harry Osborn; romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the Black Cat; and enemies such as the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, and Venom.
        In his origin story, Spider-Man gets his superhuman spider-powers and abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider; these include superhuman strength, agility, reflexes, stamina, dura…

        <i><b>/</b>Puny Parker</i></b> <br>
        <br>
        <p>High school student and child prodigy Peter Parker submerged himself in his passion for science to avoid the taunts and threats of his fellow classmates and stumbled into a world beyond his imagination.
        While visiting a public exhibition of new breakthroughs in radiation manipulation and genetics, Parker feels the bite of a common house spider exposed to a particle beam and falls immediately ill from it, little realizing how much his life would change in the coming hours.
        
        On the way home, the teenager unconsciously avoids a wayward automobile by making an incredible leap to the wall of a nearby building, finding himself miraculously able to stick to it by his hands and feet. Quickly realizing he had somehow acquired the abilities of a spider, he begins testing his newfound powers and marvels at their width and breadth. Parker tests his spider abilities in the ring of a local wrestling competition and, wearing a mask to hide his identity, easily bests the reigning champion.
        
        Parker, an orphan, lives with his kindly Aunt May and Uncle Ben and becomes wary of exposing them to the public scrutiny that would surely ensue if he revealed his powers to the world. To protect them, he adopts a suitable costume and the name of “Spider-Man” to hide his true identity. He also designs and crafts two wrist-worn “web-shooters” to approximate a spider’s web-spinning capability, and with them swiftly becomes a smash television personality. Now with money to take care of his guardians and acclaim to salve puny Peter Parker’s wounds from classmates, the young man grows cold to everything but his media-darling career.</p>
